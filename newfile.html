<h1 class="headings">1)MINOAN CIVILISATION IN CRETE AND AEGEAN- <SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">2000BCE TO 1450BCE</span></H1>
<p class="paras" id="greek1"><img src="greek1.jpeg" class="center">
The Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age Aegean civilization on the island of Crete and other Aegean Islands, whose earliest beginnings were from c. 3500 BC, with the complex urban "civilization" beginning around 2000 BC, and then declining from c. 1450 BC until it ended around 1100 BC, during the early Greek Dark Ages.[1] It represents the first advanced civilization in Europe, leaving behind a number of massive building complexes, sophisticated art, and writing systems. Its economy benefited from a network of trade around much of the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>
The Minoan civilization is particularly notable for its large and elaborate palaces up to four storeys high, featuring elaborate plumbing systems and decorated with frescoes. Much the largest Minoan palace is that of Knossos, followed by that of Phaistos. The function of the palaces, like most aspects of Minoan governance and religion, remains unclear. The Minoan period saw extensive trade by Crete with Aegean and Mediterranean settlements, particularly those in the Near East. Through traders and artists, Minoans cultural influence reached beyond Crete to the Cyclades, the Old Kingdom of Egypt, copper-bearing Cyprus, Canaan and the Levantine coast and Anatolia. Some of the best Minoan art was preserved in the city of Akrotiri on the island of Santorini; Akrotiri had been effectively destroyed by the Minoan eruption.

<h1 class="headings">2)MYCENAEAN CIVILISATION IN GREECE AND AEGEAN-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">1400BCE TO 750BCE</span></H1>
<p class="paras" id="greek2"><img src="greek2.jpg" class="center">
The Mycenaean civilization marks the declining phase of the Bronze Age in ancient Greece. It showcases the beginnings of an advanced culture in Greece, exemplified by its architecture, writings, art, and public organization. The Mycenaean Greeks made innovations in the fields of military infrastructure, engineering, and architecture. These discoveries influenced trade in the Mediterranean and advanced their economy. Moreover, Linear B, their syllabic script, has been confirmed as one of the first written records in the Greek language. Their religion included many deities that are also part of the Olympic pantheon. The civilization was controlled by an elite warrior class which ruled from a web of palace states. These states developed political, hierarchical, economic, and social systems which were entirely inflexible. The king or wanax was the head of society.<br/><br/>

The Minoan civilization (2700 BC–1100 BC) which preceded the Mycenaean civilization, was a great influence on the development of the latter. Art, architecture, and religious practices were now better expressed, and the major Mycenaean centers included Mycenae, which was also the ancient home of Agamemnon; Tiryns, which was considered to be the oldest hub; Pylos, Nestor’s home; Sparta; and probably Athens.

<h1 class="headings">3)THE TROJAN WAR-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">1260BCE TO 1180BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="greek3">
<img src="greek3.jpg" class="center">
The actual existence of the Trojan War has always been ambiguous and debatable. While some scholars take it as a myth, others have found solid proof that it happened. In Greek mythology, the Trojan War is the battle between the people of Troy and the Greeks. The conflict began after Paris, the Trojan prince, took away Helen, the wife of Menelaus of Sparta. When Menelaus asked for her return, the Trojans refused to give her back. Menelaus then cajoled his brother Agamemnon into leading an army against Troy. Agamemnon had the Greek heroes Ajax, Achilles, Odysseus, and Nestor with him, followed by a fleet of more than a thousand ships from all over the Hellenic world.<br/><br/>

For the next nine years, the Greeks attacked Troy, its neighboring cities, and countryside. But the well-fortified town, guarded by Prince Hector and other sons of the Trojan royal family, held out and won the war. Not accepting defeat, the Greeks built a giant wooden horse to hide small groups of warriors inside. Despite repeated warnings by both Laocoön and Cassandra not to take the horse into the city, the Trojan king let it in. At night the Greeks returned, and their hidden countrymen piled out of the horse. They opened the city gates and attacked each and every person who stood in their way. Troy was finally destroyed.

<h1 class="headings">4)BEGINNING OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">776BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="greek4"><img src="greek4.png" class="center">The ancient Olympic Games were primarily considered part of a religious festival which took place in honor of the father of the Greek gods and goddesses, Zeus. The celebration and the games were held in Olympia, a rural sanctuary in the western Peloponnese. The sanctuary’s name came from Mount Olympus which was the highest mountain on the Greek mainland, and was believed to be the home of the Greek gods and goddesses. The ancient Olympic Games began when, in 776 BC, Koroibos, a cook from the nearby city of Elis, won the stadion which was a 600-foot-long race.<br/><br/>

Apparently beginning with just a single foot race, the program grew to include 23 contests; an Olympiad never features more than 20. Participation in most events was limited to male athletes, but the equestrian events did allow women to take part by entering their own horses in these competitions. Running, boxing, pankration, horse racing, wrestling, chariot racing, two stade races, a long jump, discus throw, and the javelin throw were some of the main events.</p>

<h1 class="headings">5)HOMER OF GREECE WRITES HIS ILIAD AND ODYSSEY-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">800BCE TO 700BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="greek5"><img src="greek5.jpg" height="1200px" class="center">Homer's two epic poems have become archetypal road maps in world mythology. The stories provide an important insight into early human society, and illustrate, in some aspects, how little has changed. Even if The Iliad itself seems unfamiliar, the story of the siege of Troy, the Trojan War and Paris’ kidnapping of Helen, the world’s most beautiful woman, are all familiar characters or scenarios. Some scholars insist that Homer was personally familiar with the plain of Troy, due to the geographical accuracy in the poem.<br/><br/>

The Odyssey picks up after the fall of Troy. Further controversy about authorship springs from the differing styles of the two long narrative poems, indicating they were composed a century apart, while other historians claim only decades –the more formal structure of The Iliad is attributed to a poet at the height of his powers, whereas the more colloquial, novelistic approach in The Odyssey is attributed to an elderly Homer.<br/><br/>

Homer enriched his descriptive story with the liberal use of simile and metaphor, which has inspired a long path of writers behind him. His structuring device was to start in the middle–in medias res– and then fill in the missing information via remembrances.<br/><br/>

The two narrative poems pop up throughout modern literature: Homer’s The Odyssey has parallels in James Joyce’s Ulysses, and his tale of Achilles in The Iliad is echoed in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fall of Gondolin. Even the Coen Brothers’ film O Brother, Where Art Thou? makes use of The Odyssey.<br/><br/>

Other works have been attributed to Homer over the centuries, most notably the Homeric Hymns, but in the end, only the two epic works remain enduringly his.</p>

<p class="paras" id="rome1"><img src="rome1.jpg" class="center">Top on the list is the origin of the founding of the city. There is an ancient tale that explains the origin as having been founded by two brothers, Romulus and Remus.
The two are said to have been adopted by a wolf and once grown sought to establish their city. They crossed the seven hills and it is there that they pondered what hill to settle on.
They allegedly consulted a bird, whoever saw more birds was considered to be favoured by the gods. Remus believed that Aventine hill was the place to settle while Palatine hill was Romulus option.<br/><br/>

Remus ruined his brothers’ wall and a fight ensued, it ended with the death of Remus. These series of events are believed to have happened in 7544 B.C.E.
After the death of his brother, Romulus was in charge of over 2 million square miles stretching from present Britain, Asia minor, Rhine river to Egypt. It is also believed that it is through the two brothers that Rome got its name.

<BR/>
<h1 class="headings">2)ROME BECAME A REPUBLIC-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">509BCE</SPAN></h1>
<p class="paras" id="rome2"><img src="rome2.jpg" class="center">After the reign of Romulus, Rome was ruled by a king and the great families, also known as the patricians. As the territory expanded, the king formed a new governing structure in 509 BC, it is when Rome was recognized as a republic.

Rome became a republic after its army overthrew and conquered the Etruscan conquerors that ruled it for centuries.

This type of leadership was emulated by other countries that saw how well it worked for the Romans. The structure was set in a way that the citizens were allowed to select their preferred leaders.<br/<br/>

Those allowed to vote were distinguished from the others by wearing a toga, they were the privileged in the society and had different social classes within themselves.

Even with the liberty to choose their preferred leaders, there was a scuffle between the wealthy and the poor in society. The poor people felt neglected and unfairly treated, they also formed the bulk majority in the army.

The poor also known as the plebians questioned why the rich benefited from their toils and why only they had to go to war. The next event explains what was done to appease both sides.</p>

<BR/>

<h1 class="headings">3)LAW OF THE 12 TABLES-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">449BCE</SPAN></h1>
<p class="paras" id="rome3"><img src="rome3.png" class="center">The rift between the plebians and the patricians deepened as time went by. The commoners wanted a law that protected their social, legal and civil rights.

To settle this, a 10-man committee was appointed to draft a law that would be inclusive to all that lived in Rome. This group was known as Decemviri, they wrote a set of laws that mollified the needs and concerns of the commoners.

The laws of the twelve tablets were formulated to have an inclusive law for all. These laws were the first law code to ever be recorded in Rome.<br/><br/>

The laws covered domestic complications, especially private property and family life. They were also allowed to marry from the patricians and also be part of the consuls.

In 287 BCE, Lex Hortensia declared the laws passed by the Concilium Plebis and that it was binding to all in the republic.

The twelve tablets would be hung in the public square during public functions or in the court and would always be referred to.</p>

<h1 class="headings">4)HANNIBAL INVADES ITALY-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">218BCE</SPAN></h1>
<p class="paras" id="rome4"><img src="rome4.jpg" class="center">In 219 B.C., Hannibal of Carthage led an attack on Saguntum, an independent city allied with Rome, which sparked the outbreak of the Second Punic War. He then marched his massive army across the Pyrenees and Alps into central Italy in what would be remembered as one of the most famous campaigns in history. After a string of victories, the most notable coming at Cannae in 216 B.C., Hannibal had gained a foothold in southern Italy, but declined to mount an attack on Rome itself. The Romans rebounded, however, driving the Carthaginians out of Spain and launching an invasion of North Africa. In 203 B.C., Hannibal abandoned the struggle in Italy to defend North Africa, and he suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of Publius Cornelius Scipio at Zama the following year. Though the treaty concluding the Second Punic War put an end to Carthage’s status as an imperial power, Hannibal continued to pursue his lifelong dream of destroying Rome up until his death in 183 B.C.
<br/><br/>
In 219 B.C., Hannibal led a Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, an independent city in the middle of the eastern Spanish coast that had shown aggression against nearby Carthaginian towns. According to the treaty that ended the First Punic War, the Ebro River was the northernmost border of Carthage’s influence in Spain; though Saguntum was south of the Ebro, it was allied with Rome, which saw Hannibal’s attack as an act of war. Carthaginian forces besieged Saguntum for eight months before the city fell. Although Rome demanded Hannibal’s surrender, he refused, instead making plans for the invasion of Italy that would mark the beginning of Second Punic War.</p>

<h1 class="headings">5)DEFEAT OF CARTHAGE AND CONTROL OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ALL THE GREEK CITY STATES-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">146BCE</SPAN></h1>
<p class="paras" id="rome5"><img src="rome5.jpg" class="center">The Third Punic War, by far the most controversial of the three conflicts between Rome and Carthage, was the result of efforts by Cato the Elder and other hawkish members of the Roman Senate to convince their colleagues that Carthage (even in its weakened state) was a continuing threat to Rome’s supremacy in the region. In 149 B.C., after Carthage technically broke its treaty with Rome by declaring war against the neighboring state of Numidia, the Romans sent an army to North Africa, beginning the Third Punic War.

Carthage withstood the Roman siege for two years before a change of Roman command put the young general Scipio Aemilianus (later known as Scipio the Younger) in charge of the North Africa campaign in 147 B.C. After tightening the Roman positions around Carthage, Aemilianus launched a forceful attack on its harbor side in the spring of 146 B.C., pushing into the city and destroying house after house while pushing enemy troops towards their citadel. After seven days of horrific bloodshed, the Carthaginians surrendered, obliterating an ancient city that had survived for some 700 years. The surviving 50,000 citizens of Carthage were sold into slavery. Also in 146 B.C., Roman troops moved east to defeat King Philip V of Macedonia in the Macedonian Wars, and by year’s end Rome reigned supreme over an empire stretching from the Atlantic coast of Spain to the border between Greece and Asia Minor (now Turkey).<br/><br/>

The Greeks had lost control of their colonies in southern Italy to the Phoenicians, who had gained control of most of the Mediterranean. But now Rome was growing to be a force to be contended with and soon a great rivalry developed between Rome and Carthage. The Romans, not at all a maritime nation, copied the Phoenician ships and built many to contrast the enemy's navy. This they soon did and first conquered Sicily in 241 BC and then Carthage itself in 146 BC, becoming the new dominators of the Mediterranean Sea, the "Mare Nostrum", which became "our sea" from then on. The Roman Empire controlled all the shores of the Mediterranean, stretched north to England and up to the Rhine river in Germany and east to Hungary, including Rumania, Turkey and all the Near East.

<h1 class="headings">1)SETTLEMENT OF NILE VALLEY BEGINS AND FIRST DYNASTIC RULE UNDER MENES-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">7000BCE TO 2780BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="egypt1"><img src="egypt1.jpg" class="center">
By about 3600 BC, Neolithic Egyptian societies along the Nile had based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals. Shortly after 3600 BC Egyptian society began to grow and advance rapidly toward refined civilization. A new and distinctive pottery, which was related to the pottery in the Southern Levant, appeared during this time. Extensive use of copper became common during this time.The Mesopotamian process of sun-dried bricks, and architectural building principles—including the use of the arch and recessed walls for decorative effect—became popular during this time.<br/><br/>

According to Manetho, the first monarch of the unified Upper and Lower Egypt was Menes, who is now identified with Narmer. Indeed, Narmer is the earliest recorded First Dynasty monarch: he appears first on the necropolis seal impressions of Den and Qa'a.his shows that Narmer was recognized by the first dynasty kings as an important founding figure. Narmer is also the earliest king associated to the symbols of power over the two lands (see in particular the Narmer Palette, a votive cosmetic palette showing Narmer wearing the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt) and may therefore be the first king to achieve the unification. Consequently, the current consensus is that "Menes" and "Narmer" refer to the same person.Alternative theories hold that Narmer was the final king of the Naqada III period[6] and Hor-Aha is to be identified with "Menes".

<p class="paras" id="egypt2"><img src="egypt2.jpg" class="center">
The Great Pyramid of Giza and the two other smaller pyramids on the site serve as the burial tombs of Egyptian pharaohs namely Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. The Great Pyramid of Giza was also known as the Pyramid of Khufu and stands 481 feet (147 meters) tall.

Khufu began constructing the pyramid in 2550 BC and it is believed that a total of 2.3 million stone blocks were used to build the monument. The average weight of each stone brick was around 2.5 to 15 tonnes.<br/><br/>

The second pyramid was built by Khufu’s son Khafre and construction began in 2520 BC. It is marked by a unique limestone feature called a sphinx with the back half resembling a lion and the front half, the pharaoh’s head. The Pyramid of Menkaure is the smallest of the three and serves more as a temple for mourning and prayer.

The Egyptians employed innovative construction techniques to build these larger-than-life complexes. All the workers were highly skilled and dedicated to the cause of their pharaoh.

<h1 class="headings">3)INVASION OF HYKSOS AND NEW WARFARE TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">2040BCE TO 1540BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="egypt3"><img src="egypt3.jpg" class="center">
From the 13th Dynasty onwards, Egypt experienced a period of social disorder and disintegration. Many Asian foreigners took advantage of the situation to gradually infiltrate the country of the Nile, where they managed to reach military positions or work in crafts and trade. This fact set the stage for the violent occupation of the country by these Asians, known as the Hyksos, who would rule for two centuries and impose a dynasty.<br/><br/>
The Hyksos were a Semitic people who migrated to the Nile Delta region and invaded Egypt around the 18th century BC, that is, between 1700 and 1900 BC, at a time of internal crisis that allowed them to conquer the government of the country, where they formed a dynasty.<br/><br/>
It is not easy to narrate when and how exactly it happened, but the fact is that at one point, the political weakness of the pharaohs of the thirteenth dynasty to keep unified Egypt led the Hyksos, who had already been progressively settling in different cities of the country, were becoming strong and were gaining power in important enclaves such as Memphis In fact, their rise to power in these cities, around 1675-1650 B.C., is usually taken as the starting point to establish the date of the fall of the 13th Dynasty.<br/><br/>
Hyksos adapted quite well to the administrative system and structures of Egypt and maintained a very large staff of Egyptian origin. In addition, they respected the writing system, the artistic models, and the clothing and traditions most characteristic of the Egyptian people. But, above all, they maintained the ritual and protocol of the Pharaonic monarchy, linked to the devotion to the god Ra.

It is true, however, that they brought with them some cultural and material manifestations of their own, such as Asian musical instruments, jewelry, ceramic forms or improvements in bronze metallurgy. Furthermore, they were responsible for introducing innovations in the field of weapons such as the curved sword or the Asian composite bow. But apart from these contributions and peculiarities, and their foreign policy more open to relations with neighboring peoples, the truth is that the history of the Hyksos in Egypt had little to do with what later historians, in an attempt to extol the virtues of the pharaohs of the New Empire.

<p class="paras" id="egypt4"><img src="egypt4.jpg" class="center">
By 1400 BC the Egyptian empire stretches from Northern Syria to the Sudan in Africa. Led by Amenhotep III, it is a golden age of wealth, power, and prosperity. Remarkable diplomacy is used to keep the empire’s rivals at bay, while the provinces of Egypt revel in their protection. Art, technology, and new ideas flourish. Egyptian rulers are seen as gods. After the death of Amenhotep III, his son Akhenaton initiates drastic changes. Consumed by a monotheist belief, he orders a new capital built in the desert, marries the beauty Nefertiti, and embarks on a campaign of religious repression. When he dies, the new capital is abandoned. The death of his son-in-law, the boy-king Tutankhamen, marks the end of the Ahmose dynasty.

THE LAST GREAT PHARAOH
A new dynasty emerges. Threatened from abroad, Ramesses II leads an army north to fight the Hittites at Kadesh. The battle becomes his crowning achievement, and the basis for a new period of stability and wealth. Resources flood into Egypt. A new capital is built, artisans revel in an explosive period of building, and The House of Life becomes the intellectual center for the empire. However, foreign powers once again threaten, and some provinces question their allegiance. After the long reign of Ramesses II, the great tombs are systematically looted, and civil war ensues.
<br/><br/>
The Middle kingdom was a golden age of peace, prosperity and achievements in the arts and architecture.
Hatshepsut was one of the few female Egyptian pharaohs. During her reign, Egyptian traders exchanged beads, iron tools and weapons for gold, ivory, ebony and incense.
Howard Carter made a thrilling discovery with King Tut’s tomb because grave robbers had not looted this tomb as they had done many others.
Under Ramses II, Egypt regained territory and built great temples, but the empire fell by 1150. This is the pharaoh associated with Moses.

<p class="paras" id="egypt5"><img src="egypt5.png" class="center">
The Ptolemaic Period began when Alexander the Great defeated the Persians in Egypt in 332 BCE. After he died in 323 BCE, his generals divided up his empire and Ptolemy took Egypt. This marked the beginning of the Ptolemaic dynasty which spanned three centuries. Initially the generals ruled in the name of Alexander’s heirs, but Ptolemy proclaimed himself king in 305 BCE. He and his successors continued to rule Egypt until the Romans conquered it in 30 BCE, suppressing several revolts including one in Upper Egypt, 205–186 BCE. The Ptolemies initially ruled from Memphis but soon moved the royal court to Alexandria, which Alexander the Great had founded on the northwest coast of Egypt. They also introduced Greek as an administrative language alongside Egyptian.<br/><br/>


The last ruler of the Ptolemaic dynasty was Queen Cleopatra VIII who committed suicide, marking the end of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, after which the Romans and Arabs ruled the country.

<h1 class="headings">1)INDUS VALLEY CIVILISATION-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">2500BCE TO 1600BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="indian1"><img src="indian1.jpg" class="center">
Indus civilization, also called Indus valley civilization or Harappan civilization, the earliest known urban culture of the Indian subcontinent. The nuclear dates of the civilization appear to be about 2500–1700 BCE, though the southern sites may have lasted later into the 2nd millennium BCE.
<br/><br/>
The Indus civilization is known to have consisted of two large cities, Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, and more than 100 towns and villages, often of relatively small size. The two cities were each perhaps originally about 1 mile (1.6 km) square in overall dimensions, and their outstanding magnitude suggests political centralization, either in two large states or in a single great empire with alternative capitals, a practice having analogies in Indian history. It is also possible that Harappa succeeded Mohenjo-daro, which is known to have been devastated more than once by exceptional floods. The southern region of the civilization, on the Kathiawar Peninsula and beyond, appears to be of later origin than the major Indus sites. The civilization was literate, and its script, with some 250 to 500 characters, has been partly and tentatively deciphered; the language has been indefinitely identified as Dravidian.<br/><br/>
The Indus civilization apparently evolved from the villages of neighbours or predecessors, using the Mesopotamian model of irrigated agriculture with sufficient skill to reap the advantages of the spacious and fertile Indus River valley while controlling the formidable annual flood that simultaneously fertilizes and destroys. Having obtained a secure foothold on the plain and mastered its more immediate problems, the new civilization, doubtless with a well-nourished and increasing population, would find expansion along the flanks of the great waterways an inevitable sequel. The civilization subsisted primarily by farming, supplemented by an appreciable but often elusive commerce. Wheat and six-row barley were grown; field peas, mustard, sesame, and a few date stones have also been found, as well as some of the earliest known traces of cotton. Domesticated animals included dogs and cats, humped and shorthorn cattle, domestic fowl, and possibly pigs, camels, and buffalo. The Asian elephant probably was also domesticated, and its ivory tusks were freely used. Minerals, unavailable from the alluvial plain, were sometimes brought in from far afield. Gold was imported from southern India or Afghanistan, silver and copper from Afghanistan or northwestern India (present-day Rajasthan state), lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, turquoise from Iran (Persia), and a jadelike fuchsite from southern India.<br/><br/>

Perhaps the best-known artifacts of the Indus civilization are a number of small seals, generally made of steatite (a form of talc), which are distinctive in kind and unique in quality, depicting a wide variety of animals, both real—such as elephants, tigers, rhinoceros, and antelopes—and fantastic, often composite creatures. Sometimes human forms are included. A few examples of Indus stone sculpture have also been found, usually small and representing humans or gods. There are great numbers of small terra-cotta figures of animals and humans.

<h1 class="headings">2)MIGRATION OF ARYAN-SPEAKING TRIBES-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">1500BCE TO 500BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="indian2"><img src="indian2.jpeg" class="center">
Foreigners from the north are believed to have migrated to India and settled in the Indus Valley and Ganges Plain from 1800-1500 BCE. The most prominent of these groups spoke Indo-European languages and were called Aryans, or “noble people” in the Sanskrit language. These Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-Iranians, who originated in present-day northern Afghanistan. By 1500 BCE, the Indo-Aryans had created small herding and agricultural communities across northern India.<br/><br/>

These migrations took place over several centuries and likely did not involve an invasion, as hypothesized by British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler in the mid-1940s. Wheeler, who was Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India from 1944 to 1948, suggested that a nomadic, Indo-European tribe, called the Aryans, suddenly overwhelmed and conquered the Indus River Valley. He based his conclusions on the remains of unburied corpses found in the top levels of the archaeological site of Mohenjo-daro, one of the great cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, whom he said were victims of war. Yet shortly after Wheeler proposed his theory, other scholars dismissed it by explaining that the skeletons were not those of victims of invasion massacres, but rather the remains of hasty burials. Wheeler himself eventually admitted that the theory could not be proven.

<h1 class="headings">3)FOUNDING OF BUDDHISM-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">536BCE TO 483BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="indian3"><img src="indian3.jpg" class="center">
Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism who later became known as “the Buddha,” lived during the 5th century B.C. 

Gautama was born into a wealthy family as a prince in present-day Nepal. Although he had an easy life, Gautama was moved by suffering in the world. <br/><br/>

He decided to give up his lavish lifestyle and endure poverty. When this didn’t fulfill him, he promoted the idea of the “Middle Way,” which means existing between two extremes. Thus, he sought a life without social indulgences but also without deprivation.

After six years of searching, Buddhists believe Gautama found enlightenment while meditating under a Bodhi tree. He spent the rest of his life teaching others about how to achieve this spiritual state.<br/><br/>
When Gautama passed away around 483 B.C., his followers began to organize a religious movement. Buddha’s teachings became the foundation for what would develop into Buddhism.

<h1 class="headings">4)MAURYAN EMPIRE AND SPREAD OF BUDDHISM-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">326BCE TO 184BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="indian4"><img src="indian4.jpg" class="center">
The Maurya Empire was a geographically extensive Iron Age historical power in ancient India, ruled by the Maurya dynasty from 322-185 BCE. Originating from the kingdom of Magadha in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (modern Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh) in the eastern side of the Indian subcontinent, the empire had its capital city at Pataliputra (modern Patna). The empire was the largest to have ever existed in the Indian subcontinent, spanning over 5 million square kilometres at its zenith under Ashoka.<br/><br/>

The Empire was founded in 322 BCE by Chandragupta Maurya, who had overthrown the Nanda Dynasty, and rapidly expanded his power,with Chanakya’s help, westward across central and western India. His expansion took advantage of the disruptions of local powers in the wake of the withdrawal westward by Alexander the Great’s armies. By 316 BCE, the empire had fully occupied Northwestern India, defeating and conquering the satraps left by Alexander. Chandragupta then defeated the invasion led by Seleucus I, a Macedonian general from Alexander’s army, and gained additional territory west of the Indus River.
<br/><br/>
In its time, the Maurya Empire was one of the largest empires of the world. At its greatest extent, the empire stretched to the north along the natural boundaries of the Himalayas, to the east into Assam, to the west into Balochistan (southwest Pakistan and southeast Iran) and into the Hindu Kush mountains of what is now Afghanistan. The Empire was expanded into India’s central and southern regions by the emperors Chandragupta and Bindusara, but it excluded a small portion of unexplored tribal and forested regions near Kalinga (modern Odisha), until it was conquered by Ashoka. It declined for about 50 years after Ashoka’s rule ended, and it dissolved in 185 BCE with the foundation of the Shunga Dynasty in Magadha.
<br/><br/>
In the 3rd century B.C., Ashoka the Great, the Mauryan Indian emperor, made Buddhism the state religion of India. Buddhist monasteries were built, and missionary work was encouraged.<br/><br/>

Over the next few centuries, Buddhism began to spread beyond India. The thoughts and philosophies of Buddhists became diverse, with some followers interpreting ideas differently than others.

<p class="paras" id="indian5"><img src="indian5.jpg" class="center">
Gupta dynasty, rulers of the Magadha (now Bihar) state in northeastern India. They maintained an empire over northern and parts of central and western India from the early 4th to the late 6th century CE. Historians once regarded the Gupta period as the classical age of India—during which the norms of Indian literature, art, architecture, and philosophy were established—but many of those assumptions have been challenged by more extensive studies of Indian society and culture between the Mauryan and Gupta periods. Among the products traditionally thought to be from the Gupta era were the decimal system of notation, the great Sanskrit epics, and Hindu art, along with contributions to the sciences of astronomy, mathematics, and metallurgy.<br/><br/>
The Classical Age of India is also called its Golden Age and refers to a time that most of the subcontinent was under the influential Gupta Empire. This extended from about 320 BCE (Before our Common Era) to approximately 550 CE (Common Era). This was a time that was characterised by large-scale development and achievements in various areas. These fields included engineering, art, science, technology, literature, mathematics, astronomy, religion and philosophy. This massive development on such a broad scale essentially led to the establishment of the Hindu culture and its main identity, which exists to this day.
The Gupta Empire was founded by Maharaja Sri-Gupta and was the model of the ideal civilisation.<br/><br/>
Muhammad Ghori invaded India in 1175 A.D. After the conquest of Multan and Punjab, he advanced towards Delhi. The brave Rajput chiefs of northern India headed by Prithvi Raj Chauhan defeated him in the First Battle of Terrain in 1191 A.D. After about a year, Muhammad Ghori came again to avenge his defeat. A furious battle was fought again in Terrain in 1192 A.D. in which the Rajputs were defeated and Prithvi Raj Chauhan was captured and put to death. The Second Battle of Terrain, however, proved to be a decisive battle that laid the foundations of Muslim rule in northern India.

<h1 class="headings">1)PREHISTORIC CAVE PAINTINGS-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;"></span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="art1"><img src="art1.webp" class="center">
Cave art, generally, the numerous paintings and engravings found in caves and shelters dating back to the Ice Age (Upper Paleolithic), roughly between 40,000 and 14,000 years ago. See also rock art.<br/><br/>

The first painted cave acknowledged as being Paleolithic, meaning from the Stone Age, was Altamira in Spain. The art discovered there was deemed by experts to be the work of modern humans (Homo sapiens). Most examples of cave art have been found in France and in Spain, but a few are also known in Portugal, England, Italy, Romania, Germany, Russia, and Indonesia. The total number of known decorated sites is about 400.<br/><br/>

Most cave art consists of paintings made with either red or black pigment. The reds were made with iron oxides (hematite), whereas manganese dioxide and charcoal were used for the blacks. Sculptures have been discovered as well, such as the clay statues of bison in the Tuc d’Audoubert cave in 1912 and a statue of a bear in the Montespan cave in 1923, both located in the French Pyrenees. Carved walls were discovered in the shelters of Roc-aux-Sorciers (1950) in Vienne and of Cap Blanc (1909) in Dordogne. Engravings were made with fingers on soft walls or with flint tools on hard surfaces in a number of other caves and shelters.

<p class="paras" id="art2"><img src="art2.jpg" class="center">
Stonehenge, on Salisbury plain in England, is one of the most recognizable monuments of the Neolithic world and one of the most popular, with over one million visitors a year. People come to see Stonehenge because it is so impossibly big and so impossibly old; some are searching for a connection with a prehistoric past; some come to witness the workings of a massive astrological observatory. The people living in the fourth millennium BC who began work on Stonehenge were contemporary with the first dynasties of Ancient Egypt, and their efforts predate the building of the Pyramids. What they created has endured millennia and still intrigues us today.<br/><br/>
The work achieved in the long third phase of Stonehenge’s construction, however, is the one which is most remarkable and enduring. Like the first phase of Stonehenge, except on a much larger scale, the third phase involved tremendous planning and organization of labor.  But, it also entailed an entirely new level of technical sophistication, specifically in the working of very hard stone. For instance, the horizontal lintel stones which topped the exterior ring of sarsen stones were fitted to them using a tongue and grove joint and then fitted to each other using a mortise and tenon joint, methods used in modern woodworking. Each of the upright sarsens were dressed differently on each side, with the inward facing side more smoothly finished than the outer. Moreover, the stones of the outer ring of sarsens were subtly modified to accommodate the way the human eye observes the massive stones against the bright shades of the Salisbury plain: upright stones were gently widened toward the top which makes their mass constant when viewed from the ground. The lintel stones also curve slightly to echo the circular outer henge. The stones in the horseshoe of trilithons are arranged by size; the smallest pair of trilithons are around 20 feet tall, the next pair a little higher and the largest, single trilithon in the south west corner would have been 24 feet tall. This effect creates a kind of pull inward to the monument, and dramatizes the outward Northeast facing of the horseshoe. Although there are many theories, it is still not known how or why these subtle refinements were made to Stonehenge, but their existence is sure proof of a sophisticated society with organized leadership and a lot of free time.

<h1 class="headings">3)MESOPOTAMIAM ART-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">3500BCE TO 539BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="art3"><img src="art3.jpg" class="center">Mesopotamian art and architecture, the art and architecture of the ancient Mesopotamian civilizations.

The name Mesopotamia has been used with varying connotations by ancient writers. If, for convenience, it is to be considered synonymous with the modern state of Iraq, it can be seen in terms of two fairly well-defined provinces: a flat alluvial plain in the south and, in the north, the uplands through which the country’s twin rivers flow in their middle courses. This geographic division of the area is reflected in the history of its cultural development from the earliest times.<br/><br/>


The first traces of settled communities are found in the northern region and date from the mid-6th millennium BCE, a period that archaeologists associate with the transition from a Neolithic to a Chalcolithic age. It is of some importance that this period also corresponds to the earliest use of painted ornament on pottery vessels, since the designs used for this purpose are the most reliable criteria by which ethnological groupings and migratory movements can be distinguished. Archaeologically, such groupings are, for the most part, arbitrarily named after the site at which traces of them were first found, and the same names are sometimes attributed to the prehistoric periods during which they were predominant. Hence, Hassuna, Hassuna-Sāmarrāʾ, and Halaf in northern Iraq are the names given to the first three periods during which known early settlements were successively occupied by peoples whose relations were apparently with Syria and Anatolia. The designs on their pottery, sometimes in more than one colour, usually consist of zones filled with “geometric” ornament in patterns reminiscent of woven fabrics. These designs are often adapted to the shape of the vessels with creditable artifice. Only in Hassuna-Sāmarrāʾ pottery do devices occasionally appear that consist of animal, bird, or even human figures, ingeniously stylized and aesthetically attractive. Such motifs, however, appear to be adopted from contemporary Iranian ceramics. The only other notable art form popular at this time is that of hominoid figurines of stone or clay, associated with primitive religious cults; however, their formal idiosyncrasies vary greatly from group to group, and the meaning of their symbolism is unknown. Nor can they—or the pottery designs—be considered as ancestral to Mesopotamian art of historical times, the antecedents of which must be sought in southern Iraq.

<h1 class="headings">4)EGYPTIAN ART-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">3100BCE TO 30BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="art4"><img src="art4.jpg" class="center">
Egyptian art and architecture, the ancient architectural monuments, sculptures, paintings, and applied crafts produced mainly during the dynastic periods of the first three millennia BCE in the Nile valley regions of Egypt and Nubia. The course of art in Egypt paralleled to a large extent the country’s political history, but it depended as well on the entrenched belief in the permanence of the natural, divinely ordained order. Artistic achievement in both architecture and representational art aimed at the preservation of forms and conventions that were held to reflect the perfection of the world at the primordial moment of creation and to embody the correct relationship between humankind, the king, and the pantheon of the gods. For this reason, Egyptian art appears outwardly resistant to development and the exercise of individual artistic judgment, but Egyptian artisans of every historical period found different solutions for the conceptual challenges posed to them.<br/><br/>
For the purposes of definition, “ancient Egyptian” is essentially coterminous with pharaonic Egypt, the dynastic structure of Egyptian history, artificial though it may partly be, providing a convenient chronological framework. The distinctive periods are: Predynastic (c. 6th millennium BCE–c. 2925 BCE); Early Dynastic (1st–3rd dynasties, c. 2925–c. 2575 BCE); Old Kingdom (4th–8th dynasties, c. 2575–c. 2130 BCE); First Intermediate (9th–11th dynasties, c. 2130–1939 BCE); Middle Kingdom (12th–14th dynasties, 1938–c. 1630 BCE); Second Intermediate (15th–17th dynasties, c. 1630–1540 BCE); New Kingdom (18th–20th dynasties, 1539–1075 BCE); Third Intermediate (21st–25th dynasties, c. 1075–656 BCE); and Late (26th–31st dynasties, 664–332 BCE).

<h1 class="headings">5)ART IN INDUS VALLEY-<SPAN STYLE="COLOR:RED;">1500BCE TO 1600BCE</span></h1>
<p class="paras" id="art5"><img src="art5.jpg" class="center">
Many Indus Valley seals include the forms of animals; some depict the animals being carried in processions, while others show mythological creations like unicorns, leading scholars to speculate about the role of animals in Indus Valley religions. Interpretations of these animal motifs include signification of membership in a clan, elite class, or kin structure. One seal from Mohenjo-daro shows a half-human, half-buffalo monster attacking a tiger. This may be a reference to the Sumerian myth of a monster created by Aruru—the Sumerian earth and fertility goddess—to fight Gilgamesh, the hero of an ancient Mesopotamian epic poem. This is a further suggestion of international trade in Harappan culture.
Indus Valley excavation sites have revealed a number of distinct examples of the culture’s art, including sculptures, seals, pottery, gold jewelry, and anatomically detailed figurines in terracotta, bronze, and steatite.<br/><br/>
Among the various gold, terracotta, and stone figurines found was a figure of a priest-king displaying a beard and patterned robe. Another figurine in bronze, known as the Dancing Girl, is only 11 centimeters high and shows a female figure in a pose that suggests the presence of some choreographed dance form enjoyed by members of the civilization. Terracotta works also included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. In addition to figurines, the Indus River Valley people are believed to have created necklaces, bangles, and other ornaments.
